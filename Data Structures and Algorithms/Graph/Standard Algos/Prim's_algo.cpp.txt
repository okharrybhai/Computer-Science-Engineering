(I) Select any vertex of given graph and add it to MST 
(II) Add the edge of minimum weight from a vertex not in MST to the vertex in MST; 
(III) It MST is complete the stop, otherwise go to step (II).

*Worst case is the worst case time complexity of Prim’s algorithm if adjacency matrix is used?
Use of adjacency matrix provides the simple implementation of the Prim’s algorithm. In Prim’s algorithm, we need to search for the edge with a minimum for that vertex. So, worst case time complexity will be O(V2), where V is the number of vertices.
